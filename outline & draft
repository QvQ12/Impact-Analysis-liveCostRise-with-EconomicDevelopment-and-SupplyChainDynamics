Analyze data on cost of living, economic development, and supply chain metrics to explore these dynamics:
1.1. How does the rising cost of living impact supply chain stability and costs?
1.2. What economic and regional factors contribute to cost increases within supply chains?
1.3. How can organizations adapt supply chain strategies to mitigate the effects of rising costs on consumers?
Teams will utilize a mix of economic, supply chain, and cost-of-living indices to develop insights and propose strategies that help businesses and policymakers maintain supply chain resilience in the face of economic pressures.


The end goal is to produce actionable insights that address the following questions:
  
2.1. Correlational Insights:
What patterns emerge between cost-of-living increases and supply chain disruptions?
Are certain regions or industries more susceptible?
  => Data Analysis and Exploration: 
      Investigate the correlation between rising living costs and supply chain variables, identifying key regions or demographics most affected. 
        
2.2. Supply Chain Resilience Modelling:
Which economic indicators most strongly impact supply chain costs.
How can these insights guide predictions of supply chain challenges?
  => Propose actionable strategies for businesses to adapt their supply chain management practices to withstand economic challenges.
  
2.3. Strategic Recommendations:
What adaptations can businesses make to their supply chains to buffer against cost increases? 
    => Propose actionable strategies for businesses to adapt their supply chain management practices to withstand economic challenges.



Available Data & Suggested Indices​

Cost of Living Data
  Consumer Price Index (CPI): Tracks changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services
  Cost of Living Index: Includes various cost-of-living factors, such as rent, food prices, and average household costs by city and country.
    
Economic Development Indicators
  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Capita: Assesses the economic output per person in a region.
  Human Development Index (HDI): A composite of life expectancy, education, and income, giving a broad view of development.
  Gini Coefficient: Reflects income inequality, indicating economic disparity.
  Unemployment Rate: Tracks economic stability and employment trends.
    
Supply Chain Metrics and Indices
  Producer Price Index (PPI): Measures changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, directly reflecting production costs.
  Logistics Performance Index (LPI): Assesses a country’s logistics environment, crucial for understanding supply chain resilience.
  Freight Rate Indices: Tracks shipping and transport costs, crucial as transportation is often impacted by cost-of-living changes.
  Supply Chain Volatility Index: Measures fluctuations in supply chain stability, helping identify which sectors are most affected by rising costs.
    
Household Income and Expenditure Data
  Average Household Income: Provides insight into purchasing power and disposable income, impacting demand and supply chain dynamics.
  Household Expenditure Data: Helps identify consumer behavior changes in response to rising costs, which impact supply chain demand.
